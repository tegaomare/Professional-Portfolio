        <p>Hey there! I'm Tega omarejedje, a passionate and driven Full Stack Web Developer with a solid foundation in computer science.
        I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Suny potsdam. I have always been fascinated by the dynamic nature of web development and the endless possibilities it offers to create innovative solutions. 
        To further enhance my skills and expand my knowledge in web development, I recently completed a rigorous three-month bootcamp at Columbia University. 
         This immersive experience allowed me to dive deep into various technologies, frameworks, and methodologies used in building robust web applications.
        My journey into web development began during my time at SUNY Potsdam, where I gained a strong understanding of computer science fundamentals, algorithms, data structures, and software engineering principles.
        This knowledge, coupled with my hands-on experience from the bootcamp, has equipped me with a well-rounded skill set in both front-end and back-end development.
